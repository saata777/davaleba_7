              <h1 class="text1">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned <br> were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I <br> honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</h1>
              <p class="text2">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a <br> transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for <br> the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 <br> weeks was the  best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve <br>  successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

               <h1 class="text1">The team was very <br> supportive and kept me <br> motivated</h1>
               <p class="text2">“ I started as a total newbie with <br> virtually no coding skills. I now work <br> as a mobile engineer for a big <br> company. This was one of the best <br> investments I’ve made in myself. “</p>

                <p class="text6">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve <br> never written a line of code. I needed <br> some structure from professionals <br> who can help me learn programming <br> step by step. I was encouraged <br> to enroll by a former student of theirs <br> who can only say wonderful things <br> about the program. The entire <br> curriculum and staff did not <br> disappoint. They were very hands-on <br> and I never had to wait long for <br> assistance. The agile team project, in <br> particular, was outstanding. It took <br> my learning to the next level in a way <br> that no tutorial could ever have. In <br> fact, I’ve often referred to it during <br> interviews as an example of my <br> developent experience. It certainly <br> helped me land a job as a full-stack <br> developer after receiving multiple <br> offers. 100% recommend!  ”</p>

The <br> program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present <br> myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest.
